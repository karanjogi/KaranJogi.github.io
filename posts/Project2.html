                The user can change the date selected by either using the date input which is provided or can compare the riderships of the various stations by clicking on next/previous day button.
                The user can select a station from the input selection dropdown or by clicking on the leaflet map and the textbox below displays all the lines which that staion is connected to.<br> <br>

It also allows the user to peek into the data by displaying the tables for each. <br><br>

                        The second tab is Two Dates tab in this tab we can compare the number of rides 
                        between two different dates for every station.

                    <li>
                        For this we have provided a Date input where in we select the two dates we want to 
                        compare and the bar graph and map and table will update.

                        In the bar graph for every station number of rides for these two dates have been plotted 
                        with two different colors so the user can see if the rides are increasing or decreasing 
                        for a particular station.

                        We have also provided this data in the form of table in the bottom wherein the user can see the 
                        same data in the form of table and also they can look at the exact number of rides.

                    <li>
                        In the map we did not provide the rides for these two dates as these can be seen in both 
                        table and graph. So instead we have chosen to show the difference between rides for these 
                        two dates. This makes this page more intuitive as increase and decrease trend can be seen in bar chart 
                        and the exact number of rides can be seen in the table and the difference can be seen in the map.

                        One of the interesting things found in data were that four of the stations 
                        with ID's 40200 40640 40500 41580 did not have a location in the location
                        dataset as the stations are closed. The location and line information for these 
                        data was manually entered in the file.

                    <li>
                        ID 40500 belongs to Washington State station which had to be manually entered into location file.
                        Wanted to look into this data to findout why it was missing in location file. Using the select station option 
                        selected this station and of all the graphs only the yearly graph was displayed.
                        <p>

                        As we can see from the bar graph there is no data after 2006 hence the daily,
                        monthly, weekday were not displayed for that particular station.
                        Upon investigating found that this station was closed in 2006.

                        As we can see from the bar graph there is no data after 2006 hence the daily,
                        monthly, weekday were not displayed for that particular station.
                        Upon investigating found that this station was closed in 2006.

                        For 23th August data on the bar graph we can see gaps. There are two stations
                        Lawrence and Berwyn which have zero rides. 
                        <p>

                        So we viewed the individual station graph just to be sure that the bargraph is correct 
                        and in the monthly graph we can see that data is only until May 2021
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        Upon investigating we found out that both the station have been closed from May 2021 as part of Phase I of the Red & Purple Modernization Project.
