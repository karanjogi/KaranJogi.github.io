This dashboard intends to unearth political funding trends and give a wholistic perspective to the election campaigns. The user can select a particular region, recipient and the amount of contribution to compare the fundings.</p>

People can also analyse which PAC or candidate raised how much from their area of interest. Professors can use this tool to explain the impact of various candidates, their strategies and lacking regions.</p>
