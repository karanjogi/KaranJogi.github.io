                    <ul>
                    <li><p>In the yearly bar graphs all the years were displayed so it was easy for the user to interpret</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The title of the graph is reactive so if we change the stationname in the selection dropdown the stationname in the title changes this is done for all the graphs which helps the user to quickly interpret the data.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>There is a dropdown called select the plottype in which we can select the plottype for a particular year so in this a select all option is included which enables the user to view all the graphs at the same time of that year in a single place</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>For the daily graphs the X axis represents date so displaying all 365 dates would make the graph cluttered so breakdown was introduced for every month in the X-axis.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>In the interesting dates tab date is shown around the date to provide a quick insight for the user on what impact the date had on cta entries.</p>
                    </li>

                    <ul>
                    <li><p>The about page gives a hollistic description of the web application.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The UI for visualization is very intuitive and simple this allows the user to clearly visualize and interpret the plots and data being displayed</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The use of colour blue on white background is very visible and the plots pop-out clearly to the user without any distraction</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The table being displayed has an option to filter out information which allows the user to dive into granular data</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The theme used for the shiny app makes all the fonts more visible and spaced which enables more readability for the data being displayed</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The axes labels are legible and the numeric values are comma spaced which helps the user to clearly interpret the values and compare the entries for both and/or each station</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The days and months labels on the x-axis are clear and convey the timeframe concisely without confusion</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li><p>The UI looks clean. No need for scrolling.
                    The colors look nice. For each station, a specific color is picked and those colors remain constant in all of the charts.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The values in the y-axis of the chart has comma separation for thousands which looks neat.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The x-axis of the monthly chart has more month ticks.  Also, the number of rides in the raw tables are comma-separated.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The dates below the daily charts do not have the year in them which is cool as it was unnecessary.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>There are separate pages: one for overviewing the data for a particular station and the other for comparison between two stations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The dates of interesting findings are highlighted in the charts with different colors. Also, the findings are documented above the chart.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The titles in all the charts describe the chart very well.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>When an option of interesting finding is choosen raw data is also presented just below the chart for those specific dates.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The fonts are large enough and clear.</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li><p>The UI page gives all the information on the landing page presented through various graphs, which are labeled according to the station name.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The station names are reactive and change upon user selection so that there is no ambiguity in the charts.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Since all the charts are present on the dashboard there is no need to navigate to any  other page</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The charts are broken down in a top down fashion i.e the topmost chart represents the year, the one below represents the months, and then the days</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The controls for the charts are placed in the sidebar which prevents any distraction while viewing the visualizations</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The topmost chart on each column remains the same until the station names are changed, which helps in giving a overview of the data</p>
                    </li>
                    </ul>
